### 💻 Recent Projects:

- **[Real-Time Sentiment Analysis Application](https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis-app)**  
  Built a real-time sentiment analysis application using Python, Twitter API, NLP techniques, and machine learning to classify sentiments from live tweets. The web app was deployed using Streamlit.

- **[NO2 Levels Prediction with GANs](https://github.com/yourusername/NO2-prediction)**  
  Developed a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model for predicting fine spatial resolution NO2 air quality maps using coarse satellite data, traffic, and weather information. Implemented uncertainty quantification techniques with Bayesian methods.

- **[Sales Forecasting Model](https://github.com/yourusername/sales-forecasting)**  
  A machine learning model that predicts sales for a retail company using historical sales data and features like holidays, promotions, and seasonality.
